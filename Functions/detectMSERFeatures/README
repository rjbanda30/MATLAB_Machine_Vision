		○ Maximally Stable Extremal Regions (MSER) algorithm
		○ The MSER object checks for the variation of the region area size between different intensity thresholds
			§ The variation must be less than the value of the MaxAreaVariation parameter to be considered stable
		○ Input Arguments
			§ I - Input image (MxN 2-D grayscale)
				□ Specified in grayscale
				□ Must be real and nonsparse
				□ Function internally converts input images to uint8 that are not uint8 before looking for MSER regions
		○ Name-Value Arguments
			§ ThresholdDelta - Step size between intensity threshold levels
				□ Step size between intensity threshold levels, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'ThresholdDelta' and a numeric value in the range (0,100]
				□ Value is express as a percentage of the input data type range used in selecting extremal regions while testing for their stability
				□ Decrease this value to return more regions
				□ Typical values range from 0.8 to 4
			§ RegionAreaRange - Size of the region
				□ Size of the region in pixels, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'RegionAreaRange' and a two-element vector
				□ The vector [minArea maxArea]allows the selection of regions containing pixels to be between minArea and maxArea, inclusive
			§ MaxAreaVariation - Maximum area variation between extremal regions
				□ Maximum area variation between extremal regions at varying intensity thresholds, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'MaxAreaVariation' and a positive scalar value
				□ Increasing this value returns a greater number of regions, but they may be less stable
				□ Stable regions are very similar in size over varying intensity thresholds
				□ Typical values range from 0.1 to 1.0
			§ ROI - Rectangular regions of interest
				□ Rectangular region of interest, specified as a vector
				□ The vector must be in the format [x y width height]
				□ When you specify an ROI, the function detects corners within the area located at [x y] of size specified by [width height]
				□ The [x y] elements specify the upper left corner of the region
		○ Output Arguments
			§ Regions - MSER regions object
				□ MSER regions object, returned as a MSERRegions object
				□ The object contains information about MSER features detected in the grayscale input image
			§ CC - Connected component structure
				□ Connected component structure, returned as a structure with four fields
				□ The Connected component structure is useful for measuring region properties using the regionprops function
				□ The four fields:
					® Connectivity: Connectivity of the MSER regions
						◊ Default: 8
					® ImageSize: Size of I
					® NumObjects: Number of MSER regions of I
					® PixelIdxList: 1-by-NumObjects cell array containing NumObjects vectors. Each vector represents the linear indices of the pixels in the element's corresponding MSER region
		○ Algorithms
			§ Intensity Threshold Levels
				□ The MSER detector incrementally steps through the intensity range of the input image to detect stable regions
				□ The ThresholdDelta parameter determines the number of increments the detector tests for stability
				□ The threshold delta value may be thought of as the size of a cup to fill a bucket with water
					® The smaller the cup, the more number of increments it takes to fill the bucket
					® The bucket may be considered as the intensity profile of the region
		○ High-level generalization
			§ MSER can be visualized by considering the intensity profile of an image representing a series of buckets
				□ Imagining the top of each bucket being flush with the ground, and a hose turned on at one of the buckets
					® As the water fills into the bucket, it overflows and the next bucket starts filling up
					® Smaller regions of water join and become bigger bodies of water, and finally the whole area gets filled
					® As water is filling up into a bucket, it is checked against the MSER stability criterion
          				® Regions appear, grow and merge at different intensity thresholds
