	• detectORBFeatures
		® Oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF feature detection method algorithm
		® The ORB keypoints are detected in regions with high intensity variance, typically discernable from inflection points
		® Input Arguments
			◊ I - Input image (M-by-N grayscale image)
				} Specified in grayscale
				} Must be real and nonsparse
		® Name-Value Arguments
			◊ ScaleFactor - Scale factor for image decomposition (1.2 - default)
				} Scale factor for image decomposition, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'ScaleFactor' and a scalar greater than 1
				} The scale value at each level of decomposition ScaleFactor(level-1), where level is any value in the range [0, NumLevels-1]
				} Given the input image of size M-by-N, the image size at each level of decomposition is M/(ScaleFactor^(level−1))  −by − N/(ScaleFactor^(level−1))
			◊ NumLevels - Number of decomposition levels (8 - default)
				} Number of decomposition levels, specified as the comma-separated pair consisting of 'NumLevels' and a scalar greater than or equal to 1
				} Increase this value to extract keypoints from the image at more levels of decomposition
				} The number of decomposition levels for extrating keypoints is limited by the image size at that level
				} The image size at a level of decomposition must be at least 63-by-63 for detecting keypoints
				} The maximum level of decomposition is calculated as levelmax = floor((log⁡(min⁡(M,N) )−log⁡(63))/(log⁡(ScaleFactor))) + 1
				} If either the default value or the specified value of 'NumLevels' is greater than levelmax the function modifies NumLevels to levelmax and returns a warning
			◊ ROI - Region of interest [1 1 M N] 
				} Region
		® Output Arguments
			◊ points - ORB keypoints
				} ORB keypoints, returned as an ORBPoints object. The object contains information about keypoints detected in the input image
		® Algorithms
			◊ The function detects keypoints from the input image by using the ORB feature detection method in "ORB: An Efficient Alternative to SIFT or SURF"
        			} Note references
